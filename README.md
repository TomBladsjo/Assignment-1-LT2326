# Assignment 1, LT2326

This repo is forked from [Adapting-OCR](https://github.com/Deepayan137/Adapting-OCR), and some of the code used in the assignment solution was borrowed from that tutorial. See [notebooks/my_ocr](https://github.com/TomBladsjo/Assignment-1-LT2326/blob/master/notebooks/my_ocr.ipynb) for details on what is my code ond what is from the tutorial.

## Notebooks
The notebook from the original tutorial can be found at [notebooks/ocr](https://github.com/TomBladsjo/Assignment-1-LT2326/blob/master/notebooks/ocr.ipynb). I adapted the code to work with the dataset I am using and ran the model for just a few eopchs to test it. See [notebooks/ocr](https://github.com/TomBladsjo/Assignment-1-LT2326/blob/master/notebooks/ocr.ipynb) for the results of that first "test-run".

My main work for this assignment is in [notebooks/my_ocr](https://github.com/TomBladsjo/Assignment-1-LT2326/blob/master/notebooks/my_ocr.ipynb).

## Data
I could not get `trdg` to work on my computer, so I have only been using the [License Plate Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/francescopettini/license-plate-characters-detection-ocr) for this assignment. 

## Report, discussion etc
